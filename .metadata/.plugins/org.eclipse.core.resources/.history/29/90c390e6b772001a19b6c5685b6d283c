		/*
		 1. We cannot instantiate an interface
		 2. Interface will have only un implemented method. So Interface can give FULL abstraction
		 3. implements keyword is used by class to implement interface
		 4. class that implements interface must implement all the method of that interface
		 5. All the interface methods are by default public and abstract
		 6. Interface cannot be declared as private, protected
		 7. Variables which is declared in interface are by default public static and final
		 8. you cannot set value in entry class because all variables are final
		 9. An interface can extend any interface but cannot implement it 
		 10. Class can implement any number of interfaces
		 11. If there are 2 or more  same methods in two interfaces and a class
		 implements both interfaces implementation of the method only once
		 Like our method Activity();
